# Music
> Between 25 and 30 tracks (1h/1h30 content)  
> About 2 and 3 minutes per title 

## Asthetic
- Dark and ominous ambiance overall
- organic synths (exemple the intro of "hate you" by poylow)  
- Strings and organs
- Pinch of trap drums (?) 
- Electric guitars in the background
- Epic distorted riffs 

## Influences
- moonlighter music
- Demon's souls
- wardrunna (band) 
- Fortissax (own track)

## Tracklist ideas
- main theme (menu) 
- in the forge
- Curse theme
- Warrior Theme
- Dungeon type 1
- Ravaging
