# The Curse Of Life
> Here are all the main ideas and development of my Game The Curse Of Life

## [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

## Synopsis

You are a former soldier cursed by a foreign god when ravaging and pillaging the north of the continent.  
Now retired in a village far in the south you start to understand the consequences of the curse. You cannot live the bloodless and calm life you wished for after the war, because you are now a werewolf.  
Your only goal is to get back and find the dark temple to lift the curse.  
  
On the world map there will be dungeons above and underground. Some will be connected by tunnels (which will serve as fast travel). 
You will be able to find loot as a warrior in these proceduraly generated dungeons.  
But sometimes you will have to fulfill the need for blood and will massacre entire villages as a werewolf. Consuming blood will heal you but also improve your constitution.
  
The game will feature fast paced action and combat as werewold and warrior and crawl in proceduraly generated dungeons and villages to collect objects and blood from living and undead foes.
